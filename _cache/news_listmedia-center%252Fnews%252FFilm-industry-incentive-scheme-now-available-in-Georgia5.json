The caravans are gone, but the Silk Road persists. The camel trains have been replaced by modern highways, railways, and pipelines through which modern \"silk and spices\"- energy, natural resources, manufactured goods, peoples and ideas - travel. Therefore, the mentioned international conference encouraged discussions and dialogue to once again highlight that the new Silk Road can become an inexhaustible resource for economic development and political stability for many countries, spreading its benefits from economic and trade to cultural and social factors.<\/p>\r\n<p>The scope of the forum was truly impressive with five discussion panels and six topical presentations, all of which contributed to reflecting today's significant issues such as Silk Road revival opportunities and challenges, contributing to the development of the Silk Road, infrastructure projects and initiatives needed to increase trade and transit at the regional level, the role of IFIs in developing the Silk Road, and simplification of market access through free trade regimes.<\/p>","tags":"","slug":"media-center\/news\/Tbilisi-Silk-Road-Forum-and-Benefits-Brought-to-Georgia","insert_admin":"1","position":"0","lang":"5","visibility":"2","status":"0"}]
